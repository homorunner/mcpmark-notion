Your goal is to create a new study-session entry in the **Computer Science Student Dashboard** page.

1. Locate the ☑️ Habit tracker section of the page.
2. **Insert a new date section** immediately **after the existing `2022-09-02` to-do items but *before* the divider block** that follows them.
   • The date must be represented by a **date mention** whose `start` value is **`2025-01-29`**.
   • The rich-text object that contains the date mention must have its **bold** annotation set to `true`.
3. Directly **beneath** this new date mention, add **exactly four unchecked to-do blocks** with the following plain text (including the leading emoji on each line):
   • 🧠 Review algorithms for technical interview
   • 📚 Study database systems chapter 7
   • ⚡ Practice system design problems
   • 🎯 Complete data structures assignment
