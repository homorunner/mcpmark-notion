# Filesystem Task 2: Read and Edit File

## 📋 Task Description

Use the filesystem MCP tools to read an existing file and make specific edits to its content.

## 🎯 Task Objectives

1. Read the content of the existing file `sample.txt` in the test directory
2. Use the `edit_file` tool to make the following changes:
   - Replace "This is a sample file for testing." with "This file has been modified by MCP."
   - Add a new line at the end: "Modified on [current date in YYYY-MM-DD format]"
3. Verify the edits were applied correctly

## ✅ Verification Criteria

- File `sample.txt` still exists in the test directory
- Original text "This is a sample file for testing." has been replaced with "This file has been modified by MCP."
- File contains "Modified on" followed by current date at the end
- Original file structure is preserved
- All other content remains unchanged

## 💡 Tips

- First use `read_file` to see the current content
- Use `edit_file` to make the specific text replacements
- Be precise with the text to replace - it must match exactly
- Add the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
