# Filesystem Task 6: File Organization and Count

## 📋 Task Description

Use the filesystem MCP tools to organize files and create a summary.

## 🎯 Task Objectives

1. Create a directory called `organized_files`
2. Use `list_directory` to find all `.txt` files in the root test directory
3. Move all `.txt` files to the `organized_files` directory using `move_file`
4. Create a file `organized_files/file_count.txt` that contains:
   - The total number of files moved
   - Current date of organization
   - Simple format: "Moved X files on YYYY-MM-DD"

## ✅ Verification Criteria

- Directory `organized_files` exists in the test directory
- All `.txt` files from root directory have been moved to `organized_files`
- No `.txt` files remain in the root test directory
- File `organized_files/file_count.txt` exists
- Count file shows correct number of moved files
- Count file includes current date in YYYY-MM-DD format

## 💡 Tips

- Use `list_directory` to find all files in the root directory
- Filter for `.txt` files only
- Keep track of how many files you move
- Use `move_file` to relocate files to the new directory
- Create the count file after moving all other files
